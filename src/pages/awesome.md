I’ve started contributing to the web around 2007 and worked with many different companies. These include agencies like [we are you](https://www.weareyou.com/), [E-sites](https://www.e-sites.nl/), [Freshheads](http://freshheads.com) and clients like [Eneco](http://eneco.com), [KNVB](http://knvb.nl), [Quinny](http://www.quinny.nl/), [Dunea](http://dunea.nl) & [Signify](https://www.signify.com).

I maintain some [repositories on GitHub](https://github.com/bramsmulders) and I’ve created [Supple Kit](https://github.com/supple-kit/). It is a collection of tools that enable speedy, accessible, and powerful web development.

Currently, I’m working as a freelance front-end UI developer at [Signify for Philips Hue](https://www.philips-hue.com).

Since the beginning of 2019, I have also started producing electronic dance music.
